## Question 4 (Fill in the Blank)

Question:**
Bowel and urinary elimination are fundamental processes essential for maintaining health and homeostasis. In older adults, these processes become increasingly significant due to the potential for age-related physiological changes and the impact on quality of life. Proper elimination ensures the removal of waste products, regulates fluid balance, and prevents conditions such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), constipation, and fecal incontinence. For geriatric patients, effective elimination processes are crucial not only for physical health but also for psychosocial well-being, as issues with elimination can lead to embarrassment, social isolation, and decreased independence.
