## Question 1 (Multiple Choice)

**Question:**

An 80-year-old female patient has been experiencing significant weight loss over the past six months, a decreased appetite, and fatigue. Upon assessment, the nurse notes she has difficulty chewing due to poorly fitting dentures and reports feeling anxious about her upcoming dental appointment. What should the nurse prioritize in the care plan for this patient?

**Options:**

- 
A) Schedule immediate surgery to correct the denture fit.

- 
B) Refer the patient to a dietitian for a specialized meal plan.

- 
C) Educate the patient on the importance of maintaining oral hygiene and encourage her to attend her dental appointment.

- 
D) Prescribe a high-calorie nutritional supplement to compensate for her decreased intake.

**Answer:**

- 
C) Educate the patient on the importance of maintaining oral hygiene and encourage her to attend her dental appointment.

**Explanation:**

The patient’s difficulty in chewing due to ill-fitting dentures is affecting her nutritional intake, leading to weight loss and fatigue. Prioritizing education about oral hygiene and encouraging her to address her dental issues is crucial for improving her ability to eat and, consequently, her nutritional status. While referral to a dietitian and nutritional supplements can be helpful later, addressing the root cause of her problem—her oral health—is essential. Immediate surgery for denture fit may not be feasible or necessary at this stage.

This question assesses knowledge of the nursing process in geriatric care, focusing on prioritizing interventions that address fundamental health issues impacting nutrition and overall well-being.

## Question 2 (Select All That Apply)

**Question:**

A nurse is assessing a group of older adult patients in a long-term care facility for potential nutritional deficiencies. Which of the following factors should the nurse consider that may contribute to malnutrition? (Select All That Apply)


### Options:

- 
A) Reduced taste and smell sensitivity

- 
B) Increased physical activity levels

- 
C) Chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart failure)

- 
D) Social isolation or lack of support

- 
E) Enhanced appetite due to increased caloric needs

**Answer:**

- 
A) Reduced taste and smell sensitivity  

- 
C) Chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart failure)  

- 
D) Social isolation or lack of support

**Explanation:**

Older adults are at a higher risk for malnutrition due to several factors, including reduced sensitivity of taste and smell, which can lead to decreased appetite (Option A). Chronic health conditions often complicate nutritional needs and can result in dietary restrictions or increased caloric needs that are not met (Option C). Social isolation can further exacerbate this issue by reducing motivation to prepare and consume meals (Option D). 

On the contrary, increased physical activity levels (Option B) typically contribute positively to nutritional status, and enhanced appetite due to increased caloric needs (Option E) is not generally observed in older adults; rather, the opposite tends to occur as metabolism slows with age.

By recognizing these contributing factors, nurses can better assess the nutritional status of older adults and implement appropriate interventions to prevent malnutrition.

## Question 3 (Ordered Response)

**Ordered Response


### Question:

**

**Question:**

Arrange the following steps in the appropriate order for assessing and managing a patient with suspected dehydration in an older adult. 

1. Evaluate the patient’s vital signs and assess for signs of dehydration (e.g., dry mucous membranes, skin turgor).
2. Educate the patient about the importance of maintaining adequate fluid intake and recognizing early signs of dehydration.
3. Monitor fluid intake and output, and perform a daily weight check.
4. Initiate a fluid replacement plan based on the assessment findings and individual needs.
5. Review the patient’s medication list to identify any that may contribute to dehydration.

**Options:**

- 
A) 1, 5, 3, 4, 2  

- 
B) 2, 1, 5, 4, 3  

- 
C) 1, 3, 5, 4, 2  

- 
D) 1, 4, 2, 3, 5

**Answer:**

- 
C) 1, 3, 5, 4, 2

**Explanation:**

The correct order begins with the initial assessment of the patient to identify signs of dehydration (Step 1). Next, monitoring fluid intake and output is crucial for ongoing assessment (Step 3). Reviewing the medication list helps determine if any medications could be exacerbating dehydration (Step 5). After evaluating these factors, a fluid replacement plan can be initiated based on the findings (Step 4). Finally, educating the patient about hydration and recognizing signs of dehydration ensures they are actively involved in their care (Step 2). 

This ordered approach ensures a thorough assessment followed by appropriate interventions, promoting effective management of dehydration in older adults.

## Question 4 (Fill in the Blank)

**Question:**

In older adults, a decrease in total body water and reduced thirst sensation can lead to an increased risk of dehydration. Common signs of dehydration include dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and __________.

**Options:**

- 
A) Increased appetite  

- 
B) Elevated blood pressure  

- 
C) Confusion  

- 
D) Improved cognitive function

**Answer:**

- 
C) Confusion

**Explanation:**

In older adults, dehydration can manifest through various symptoms, including confusion, which may occur due to inadequate fluid levels affecting brain function. As hydration status declines, cognitive impairment can become more pronounced, leading to confusion and disorientation. Recognizing these signs is crucial for timely intervention to prevent further complications.

## Question 5 (Chart/Exhibit)

**Question:**

Based on the provided chart of common electrolyte imbalances and their respective clinical manifestations, which of the following findings would be most indicative of hyperkalemia in an older adult patient?

**Options:**

- 
A) Increased muscle rigidity and hyporeflexia  

- 
B) Bradycardia and peaked T waves on ECG  

- 
C) Hypotension and cold, clammy skin  

- 
D) Polyuria and decreased serum creatinine

**Answer:**

- 
B) Bradycardia and peaked T waves on ECG

**Explanation:**

Hyperkalemia, or elevated potassium levels in the blood, can lead to significant cardiovascular changes. Bradycardia (slow heart rate) and characteristic ECG changes such as peaked T waves are classic signs of hyperkalemia. In older adults, the risk of hyperkalemia can be increased due to factors such as renal impairment or the use of medications that affect potassium levels. 

Option A (increased muscle rigidity and hyporeflexia) is more indicative of hypokalemia. Option C (hypotension and cold, clammy skin) may reflect hypovolemic shock or another acute condition, and option D (polyuria and decreased serum creatinine) does not align with hyperkalemia as it is more associated with renal function rather than potassium levels.

This question emphasizes the importance of recognizing and interpreting clinical signs of electrolyte imbalances in geriatric patients, enabling appropriate nursing interventions and management strategies.
