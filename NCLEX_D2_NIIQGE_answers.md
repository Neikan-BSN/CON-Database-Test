Answer to Question 1 (Multiple Choice)

Question:
Answer:
C) Stress Incontinence  

###

Explanation:
Stress incontinence is characterized by involuntary leakage of urine that occurs during activities that increase abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercising. In this scenario, the patient's symptoms of leakage during physical activity, combined with her feelings of embarrassment and social isolation, suggest that she is experiencing stress incontinence. Urge incontinence would typically involve a sudden, strong urge to urinate, often leading to leakage before reaching the bathroom, which does not align with the patient's description. Functional incontinence relates to physical or cognitive impairments that prevent timely access to the toilet, and overflow incontinence is associated with bladder overdistension and dribbling rather than activityrelated leakage.

This question tests the understanding of different types of urinary incontinence, which is critical for effective assessment and intervention in geriatric nursing care.


Answer to Question 2 (Select All That Apply)

Question:
Answer:
B) Increased fluid intake can help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in older adults.
C) Decreased mobility can contribute to constipation in the elderly.
E) Regular toileting schedules can help manage urinary incontinence.

Explanation:

 A) is incorrect because while changes in bowel and urinary elimination become more common with age, they are not a normal part of aging and should be assessed and managed appropriately.
 B) is correct because increased fluid intake helps flush the urinary tract, reducing the risk of infections.
 C) is correct as decreased mobility can slow the movement of the intestines, leading to constipation.
 D) is incorrect because fecal incontinence is not an inevitable consequence of aging; it can often be treated or managed effectively.
 E) is correct since establishing regular toilet schedules can significantly help manage urinary incontinence in older adults.

This question and its corresponding explanations highlight the importance of understanding the nuances of bowel and urinary elimination in older adults, which is essential for effective geriatric nursing care.


Answer to Question 3 (Ordered Response)

Question:
Answer:
A) 1, 3, 5, 2, 4

Explanation:
  
1. Educating the patient on increasing dietary fiber intake is the first step as it addresses the root cause of constipation.  
3. Encouraging regular physical activity is the next logical step, as it aids in promoting bowel motility.  
5. Establishing a regular toileting schedule helps the patient develop a routine, which can improve bowel habits.  
2. Monitoring the patient's bowel habits and assessing for signs of impaction is critical to ensure that interventions are effective and to prevent complications.  
4. Administering a prescribed laxative should be considered only after the initial dietary and lifestyle modifications have been attempted, as laxatives are typically a secondary approach.  

This structured approach facilitates a comprehensive management plan for constipation in older adults, ensuring that nonpharmacological methods are prioritized before pharmacological interventions are introduced.


Answer to Question 4 (Fill in the Blank)

Question:
Answer:
C) Implement a scheduled drinking routine throughout the day.

Explanation:

Older adults often experience a diminished thirst sensation, which can lead to inadequate fluid intake and increase the risk of dehydration. Implementing a scheduled drinking routine helps ensure that they consume adequate fluids regularly, regardless of their thirst cues. This proactive approach can help maintain hydration status and prevent complications associated with dehydration. In contrast, options A and B may further exacerbate the issue, while option D may not effectively contribute to hydration and could lead to increased diuresis.


Answer to Question 5 (Chart/Exhibit)

Question:
Answer:
B) Educate Mrs. A on pelvic floor exercises and bladder training techniques.

Explanation:

Mrs. A's symptoms suggest a form of urinary incontinence, likely stress incontinence given the leakage during activities that increase abdominal pressure (coughing or sneezing). Educating her on pelvic floor exercises (Kegel exercises) can strengthen the pelvic muscles, potentially reducing the episodes of leakage. Additionally, bladder training can help improve her urinary control.

While increasing fluid intake (Option A) might be beneficial for hydration, it could also exacerbate her nocturia if not managed carefully. Discontinuing the diuretic (Option C) may not be advisable without consulting with her healthcare provider, as her hypertension needs to be managed effectively. Finally, although limiting caffeine and alcohol (Option D) can be helpful, the priority should be on directly addressing her urinary symptoms through pelvic floor exercises and bladder training. 

Assessing her medications for contributions to her symptoms is also important, but the immediate management plan should focus on empowering her with strategies to manage her incontinence.
